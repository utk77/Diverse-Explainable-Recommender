# Mitigating Filter Bubbles: Diverse and Explainable Recommender Systems

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a novel diversity-enhanced recommender system built upon an existing Explainable Recommender model. The project introduces a Diversity Module to mitigate filter bubbles in recommender systems, improving content diversity and fairness in recommendations.


## Motivation
The surge in online content has necessitated the development of intelligent recommender systems capable of offering personalized suggestions to users. However, these systems often encapsulate users within a "filter bubble," limiting their exposure to a narrow range of content. This project seeks to break this cycle by integrating a novel diversity module into a knowledge graph-based explainable recommender system. By employing principles of Shannon Entropy, this diversity module fosters a broader spectrum of recommendations while maintaining transparency and user trust. The implementation utilizes the MovieLens 1M dataset to create a richer, more inclusive user experience, marking a significant step toward enhancing recommendation diversity and explainability.


## Features
- **Diversity Module**: Introduces an entropy-based diversity score to improve content variation.
- **Knowledge Graph Integration**: Uses structured knowledge from the MovieLens dataset for enhanced explainability.
- **Neural-Symbolic Learning**: Employs a hybrid model for learning user preferences and generating interpretable recommendations.
- **Customizable Training**: Supports hyperparameter tuning for model optimization.

## Dataset
This implementation is tested on the **MovieLens 1M dataset**, mapped to a knowledge graph to enhance explainability. The dataset is included under the `data` directory. Please ensure compliance with the [MovieLens Terms of Use](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).
